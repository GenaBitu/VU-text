\chapter{An algebraic formalism for Multi-instance learning}

\VUname{Multi-instance learning} is a class of machine learning algorithms, first described by \cite{dietterich_solving_1997}, that can theoretically be used for both \VUname{supervised} (see \cite{amores_multiple_2013}) as well as \VUname{unsupervised} (see \cite{zhang_multi-instance_2009}, \cite{chen_contextual_2012}) learning. While classical machine learning algorithms typically require a sample to be represented as a vector of numbers, multi-instance learning relaxes this requirement by representing a sample as a \VUname{bag} of an arbitrary number of objects. \cite{dedic_hierarchicke_2017} describes a novel approach to the formalization of multi-instance learning, a liberal translation of which constitutes the following chapter.
